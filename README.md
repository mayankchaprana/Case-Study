# Case-Study

Zomato was an application, which provided users complete information about the restaurants and food joints for over 1.4 million restaurants, in around 10,000 cities across 23 countries.
Zomato was a platform not only for food lovers, but also for food servers and restaurant service providers.

Zomato has since started focusing on evolving the product offering and has expanded the product portfolio to offer six products - the Zomato restaurant finder app (search and discovery), Zomato for Business (app for restaurant managers), Zomato Order (for Online Ordering), Zomato Book (table reservations), Zomato Cashless (in app payments) and Zomato Base (POS).

The key strength of Zomato was the coverage and in-depth knowledge of food with different reviews. The continuous updating of reviews and increasing number of registered restaurants in comparison to its competitors
gave an edge over others.

The theme of Zomato was always "For the Love for Food", and the belief was that the best way to build relationships is by talking to the clients passionately about your own brand.

Zomato was in full momentum in just six months and around 5 lakh users were visiting their websites every month. Now it was high time to formalise this channel and make an effective presence and brand visibility through various campaigns.

Zomato was targeted to provide restaurant owners a platform to market themselves online.
Many small restaurants could not maintain their website, but now could have an easy customer access through online advertising.
